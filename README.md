# music-theory

The only reason this project exists is because I wanted to review some music theory concepts without having to google them every time.
The project is currently implemented as a CLI that simply prints out the chord or scale that the user requests. As I learn more concepts in music theory, I will implement them in the CLI as well for lookup.

## Usage

To run this tool, simply run the following on your terminal:

```
./main.py
```

If you are on a windows machine, you need to install Python 3.11 onwards, and then run the following:

```
python main.py
```
