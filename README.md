# music-theory

A fun project to visualize Music Theory concepts.
The project is currently implemented as a CLI that simply prints out the chord or scale that the user requests.
However, we plan to build either a website or mobile application that would allow users to better interact and learn the concepts.

## Usage

To run this tool, simply run the following on your terminal:

```
./main.py
```

If you are on a windows machine, you need to install Python 3.11 onwards, and then run the following:

```
python main.py
```
